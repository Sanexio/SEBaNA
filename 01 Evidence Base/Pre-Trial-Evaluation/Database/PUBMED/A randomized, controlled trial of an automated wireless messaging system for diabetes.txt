BACKGROUND: Aggressive management of blood glucose reduces future
diabetes-related complications, but this is difficult to achieve.
METHODS: This randomized, controlled study tested the effect of using a wireless 
two-way pager-based automated messaging system to improve diabetes control
through facilitated self-management. The system sent health-related messages to
patients, with automatic forwarding of urgent patient responses to the health
care team.
RESULTS: Participants in both the experimental (pager) and the control groups
experienced an average hemoglobin A1c decrease of 0.1-0.3%. More patients in the 
pager group were normotensive, and more felt that their health care was better by
the end of the study. A total of 79% of participants enjoyed using the pager, and
68% wanted to continue using the system.
CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing a wireless, automated messaging system in clinical
practice is a feasible, low-cost, interactive way to facilitate diabetes
self-management, which is acceptable to patients. While providing a convenient
way for patients and providers to communicate, this system can support automated 
recording and ready retrieval of these real-time interactions.
