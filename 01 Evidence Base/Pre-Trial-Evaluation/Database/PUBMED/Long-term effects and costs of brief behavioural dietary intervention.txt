This study evaluated the 12-month follow-up results and costs of a personalized, 
medical office-based intervention focused on behavioral issues related to dietary
self-management. Two hundred and six adults having diabetes attending an internal
medicine outpatient clinic visit were randomized to either Usual Care or to Brief
Intervention. The single session intervention involved touchscreen
computer-assisted assessment that provided immediate feedback on key barriers to 
dietary self-management, goal setting and problem-solving counselling. Follow-up 
components included phone calls and videotape intervention relevant to each
participant. Brief Intervention produced significantly greater improvement than
Usual Care on multiple measures of change in dietary behaviour (e.g., covariate
adjusted difference of 2.2% of calories from fat; p = 0.023) and on serum
cholesterol levels (covariate adjusted difference of 15 mg/dl; p = 0.002) at
12-month follow-up. There were also significant differences favouring
intervention on patient satisfaction (p < 0.02) but not on HbA1c levels. The
costs of intervention ($137 per patient) were modest relative to many commonly
used practices.
