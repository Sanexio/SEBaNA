Effect of computer-based learning on diabetes knowledge and control.

Two interactive computer-based systems have been evaluated: a teaching program
with text and animated graphics and a multiple-choice knowledge-assessment
program (KAP) with optional prescriptive feedback. One hundred seventy-four
routine-attending insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients were allocated to active
and control groups to determine the effect of these programs on knowledge and
control after a 4- to 6-mo follow-up period. Interactive computer teaching (ICT) 
resulted in a significant knowledge increment in both IDDM and NIDDM patients (P 
less than .05), together with a mean fall of 0.8 and 0.7%, respectively, in HbA1c
(P less than .05 and P greater than .1), but no changes were observed in
respective control groups. The KAP with feedback also produced a significant
knowledge increment in both IDDM and NIDDM patients (P less than .05), of similar
magnitude to the ICT program, and a mean fall in HbA1c of 1.2 and 1.3%,
respectively (P less than .05), with no changes in the corresponding control
groups. Even when KAP was used without prescriptive feedback, smaller but
significant mean falls in HbA1c of 0.7 and 0.8% (P less than .05) were seen in
IDDM and NIDDM patients, respectively, suggesting a motivational effect resulting
from program participation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
