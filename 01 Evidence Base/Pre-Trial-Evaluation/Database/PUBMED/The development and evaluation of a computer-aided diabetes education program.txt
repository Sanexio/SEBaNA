The development and evaluation of a computer-aided diabetes education program.

Lo R, Lo B, Wells E, Chard M, Hathaway J.

This paper describes the development and evaluation of a computer-aided learning 
(CAL) program. The program was tested in a trial that involved 36 people with
diabetes; 20 received CAL lessons in diabetes management and 16 attended
conventional diabetes classes conducted by diabetes educators. When measurements 
taken before and three months after the education were compared, both groups
showed significant improvement in their knowledge; the blood glucose levels of
the CAL group were significantly lower but those of the conventional education
group were higher. This means that the CAL program was as effective as
conventional education in imparting knowledge but it was more likely to motivate 
people to control their glucose levels. The CAL program allows diabetes educators
to spend less time on education in basic knowledge and to concentrate more on
motivational and social factors that are important determinants of patient
compliance. It can also benefit people with diabetes whose access to health
professionals and/or conventional diabetes education is restricted.
