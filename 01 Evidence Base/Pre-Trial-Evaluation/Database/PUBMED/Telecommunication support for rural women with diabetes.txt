PURPOSE: The Women to Women Diabetes Project tested the use of telecommunication 
technology to deliver diabetes education and social support to rural women with
diabetes. The aims were to (1) test the effects of the computer intervention in
providing support, information, and education on selected outcomes, and (2)
evaluate the women's attitudes toward and satisfaction with the intervention and 
the support provided.
METHODS: Thirty women were randomized into computer and noncomputer groups and
participated for 10 months. For 5 months, one group participated in a self-help
support and educational group via the computer; the other group continued to use 
their usual modes of support and communication. Psychosocial well-being scales
were administered and attitudes were surveyed.
RESULTS: Improving health and higher educational levels positively influenced
measures of social support and quality of life. Women who were married or who
reported greater support had higher scores on the Personal Resource
Questionnaire. The women expressed positive effects of the computer-based support
group on their lives.
CONCLUSIONS: The intervention was enthusiastically accepted, and could be
conducted effectively in isolated rural areas.
